Data : Crime in Vancouver

The data comes from the Vancouver Open Data Catalogue.
It was extracted on 2017-07-18 and it contains 530,652 records from 2003-01-01 to 2017-07-13.
The original data set contains coordinates in UTM Zone 10 (columns X and Y).
It also includes Latitude and Longitude data of each neighbourhood.
The columns are Type of Crime, Year, Month, Day, Hour, Hundred_Block,Neighbourhood, Latitude and Longitude.

I am going to cluster the neighbourhoods based on the type of crime so as to understand which type of crime
is the most likely to happen in a particular  neighbourhood.
